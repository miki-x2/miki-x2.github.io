summary: "A simple period tracking app I developed for EE 296"
---

As a woman, tracking menstrual cycles are very useful and important as it helps gauge when to expect the next cycle, understand why cramps are occuring, and to look for signs of irregularity. A lot of the applications I used in the past are either too complicated to use or lacks the feautres I want. I developed a simple application that is easy to use and has the functionalities that were lacking in most applications that are on the market. Since I am passionate about fitness and health, I wanted my application to not just track my menstrual cycle, but also help me log my mood, appetite, sleep, water intake, and if I am experiencing any symptoms. 

This was an individual project in which I was responsible for planning, designing, and implementing the application from scratch. I developed this application using Kotlin and Android Studio, in which I learned by going through the training on the Android Developers website. I used an open source database called Realm to update, store, and access data. 

Throughout this project, I learned effective time management skills. Since I was expected to learn a new programming language and IDE to build an application, I had to pace myself throughout the online training to make sure I have enough time to create the application. I also learned how good programming skills are insufficient in developing a good UI, as you need to keep new user's usage in mind. The UI of an application should be simple and intuitive to use, but attractive at the same time. 

Here are some screenshots highlighting my application:

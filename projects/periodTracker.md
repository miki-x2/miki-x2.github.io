As a woman, tracking menstrual cycles is very useful and important as it helps gauge when to expect the next cycle, understand why cramps are occurring, and look for signs of irregularity. A lot of the applications I used in the past are either too complicated to use or lack the features I want. I developed a simple application that is easy to use and has the functionalities that are lacking in most applications that are on the market. Since I am passionate about fitness and health, I wanted my application to not just track my menstrual cycle, but also help me log my mood, appetite, sleep, water intake, and if I am experiencing any symptoms. 

## Role and Contribution
This was an individual project in which I was responsible for planning, designing, and implementing the application from scratch. I developed this application using Kotlin and Android Studio, which I learned by going through the training on the Android Developers website. I used an open-source database called Realm to update, store, and access data. 

## Learning Experience
Throughout this project, I learned effective time management skills. Since I was expected to learn a new programming language and IDE to build an application, I had to pace myself throughout the online training to make sure I had enough time to create the application. I also learned how good programming skills are insufficient in developing a good UI, as you need to keep new user's usage in mind. The UI of an application should be simple and intuitive to use, but attractive at the same time.

The Micro VIP is one of the vertically-integrated projects offered at UH Manoa. I joined in Spring 2023 and worked in a small team to improve the Embryo Image Analysis application that previous teams have been working on. For my team specifically, our goals were to improve the neural network and resolve the overfitting of the trophectoderm epithelium (TE) and the underfitting of the inner cell mass (ICM) and implement a logging system that helps developers debug the application. 

I primarily worked on implementing a simple logging system in Python that consists of print statements that are useful for developers to see what is occuring in the program. I also contributed to testing new functions that my other team members created to ensure the output displays the desired results.

Throughout this project, I not only explanded my software engineering skills, but I experienced working on a large, existing project with others. It was my first time seeing and working on a project with more than ten separate directories and over a thousand lines of code for some of the files. Although I was initimidated and overwhelmed, I learned how to read and understand code that is written by others. With this experience,  was able to adopt good coding skills to ensure others can understand exactly what I am trying to implement in the program. I also learned good communication and collaboration skills, as I worked with different people who came from different backgrounds, experience, and knowledge.

<h2 id="how-it-started">How It Started</h2>

<p>Like many of my peers, I started using the computer from a very young age. Fascinated by the rapid advancement of technology, I knew I wanted to pursue a career in STEM. However, being a first-generation college student and my parents working in non-STEM fields, I was lost at finding which major suits me the most. Not knowing my passion for technology, my family encouraged me to pursue medicine.</p>

<p>Up until my junior year of high school, I spent most of my time in the health academy to learn about human anatomy, forensics, nutrition, and clinical health. Although I enjoyed experiencing the medical field, AP chemistry was a turning point for me. I quickly became dreaded—even terrified—at the thought that I might have to write chemical equations for the rest of my life. I knew I had to change my decision before I suffer myself. So for my senior class registration, I took AP computer science, which ignited my passion for programming. Wanting to learn and experience both software and hardware, I chose computer engineering as my major.</p>

<h2 id="from-computer-engineering-to-mechanical-engineering-and-back-to-computer-engineering">From Computer Engineering to Mechanical Engineering and Back to Computer Engineering</h2>

<p>After experiencing two years of college completely online, I found it difficult to stay motivated. Circuits were all simulated and I had a hard time keeping up with online lectures. As a highly introverted person, it was daunting for me to unmute myself during lectures or reach out to other students for help. Afraid that I would not last long in computer engineering, I decided to give mechanical engineering a try.</p>

<p>Spring 2022 was my very first semester on campus. In my mechanical engineering class, I was randomly assigned to a team to build an app-controlled robot that could climb two flights of stairs to retrieve an egg and come back. Having no prior experience in mechanical engineering, I stayed in my comfort zone of working with electrical components. For software development, I had to independently learn object-oriented programming in C++ for the first time to program the Arduino microcontroller. Although difficult, I found joy and excitement in this task. The moment I saw our robot successfully move by my programming, I knew it was time for me to go back to computer engineering. Although many would think it was a waste of time for me to be in mechanical engineering for a semester, which unfortunately pushed back my graduation a semester later than originally expected, I look at it as a valuable experience no other computer engineering major could have experienced.</p>

<h2 id="where-i-am-today">Where I Am Today</h2>

<p>This past summer, I was very fortunate to be a software engineer intern at a local software company, RVCM. There, I worked on my software engineering and team collaboration skills and developed an interest in both frontend and backend engineering. Due to the time constraints, however, I was not able to experience frontend development nor use tools such as React and JavaScript. My hope for ICS 314 is that I will be able to expand my knowledge and skills in these tools and strengthen my professionalism as a software engineer. By the end of the semester, I hope to become a confident software engineer and be able to understand both frontend and backend development. My ultimate goal is to become a competent and professional engineer who can effectively collaborate with others on a team.</p>

## Overview
The problem: Students and faculty often have a difficult time advertising or offering positions to students who are looking for a capstone project. Although there are physical bulletin boards on campus for advertising, students may find them difficult to access as they are located in various areas of campus and the information can be scattered everywhere. With our solution, projects can easily be advertised and those seeking a project to join can find available capstone projects to join.

The solution: Our solution is to modernize the physical bulletin boards on campus by creating a digital bulletin board. The digital bulletin board would allow students and faculty to create posts for students seeking projects to join or a faculty to oversee their projects to view. 

## Mockup page ideas
- Landing page
- User home page
- Admin home page
- User profile page.
- Browse projects by major, interests, goals, end date, etc.
- Post new projects with major, interests, goals, end date, etc.

## Use case ideas
- New user goes to the landing page, logs in, goes to the home page, and sets up a profile.
- Admin goes to the landing page, logs in, goes to the home page, and edits the site.
- User goes to the landing page, logs in, finds projects with their compatible major or interests, and contacts them.
- User goes to the landing page, logs in, create a new project with contact info so people can contact them.

## Beyond the basics
- Before a project is submitted and posted on the site, the admin first reviews and approves of the project.
- Allowed to follow certain majors and get notifications for recently uploaded projects.
- Get notifications on projects that you applied for.
- Notifications via email (like a email notification subscription)

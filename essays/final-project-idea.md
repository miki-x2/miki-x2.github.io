## Overview
The problem: Students and faculty often have a difficult time advertising or offering positions to students who are looking for a capstone project. Although there are physical bulletin boards on campus for advertising, students may find them difficult to access as they are located in various areas of campus and the information can be scattered everywhere. With our solution, projects can easily be advertised and those seeking a project to join can find available capstone projects to join.

The solution: Our solution is to modernize the physical bulletin boards on campus by creating a digital bulletin board. Our digital bulletin board  allows students and faculty to post their projects for students seeking projects to join or a faculty to oversee their projects to view.
